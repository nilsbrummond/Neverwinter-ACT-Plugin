Neverwinter-ACT-Plugin
======================

An plugin for ACT (Advanced Combat Tracker) to parse combat log file from Neverwinter by Perfect World.

- ACT is found at http://advancedcombattracker.com/
- D&D Neverwinter is found at http://nw.perfectworld.com/

This plugin is based on the version 0.0.5.1 plugin by Antday \<Unique\>, 
which is based on the STO plugin from Hilbert @ mancom, Pirye @ ucalegon.


State
=====
- Needs testing and verification.
- Tracking of CW Chaotic Growth gives the healing credit to the last CW to MM the target.
- Companion pet's may not be handled the best way
- Really wish we could detect zone changes.
- I'm sure there are losts of different special cases left to handle.
- Combat log colored.
- Companion Pet's owners tracked.


Install
=======

- Download the Neverwinter.cs file to your computer.
